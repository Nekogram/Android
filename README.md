# Nekogram
After releasing Nekogram 7.1, the devs of Nekogram pulled their GitHub page and made the code obfuscated.

But, Nekogram is a fork of [Telegram for Android](https://www.github.com/drklo/Telegram), which is licensed under a license that prohibits, among other things, the creation of closed source forks.

And Nekogram just became one.

This also means DrKLO, the developer of Telegram for Android, can force them to pull the app. The obfuscated code means it's harder to see that they're using code identical to the one in official Telegram, but I have put a few links to older source code below.
